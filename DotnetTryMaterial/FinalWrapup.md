Thank you for going through this tutorial and trying out this experiment of using **dotnet try**. I would greatly 
appeciate feedback on using **dotnet try** and if this is something I should do more of. Feel free to open 
up GitHub issues for feedback or fork the repo and send those PRs to fix my typos.
