# Stream processing wrap up

We have completed deploying a Lambda function that handles processing service events. In this example we
handled changes done to our DynamoDB Table but we could have just as easily used Lambda to handle events 
from S3 when objects are uploaded or when messages are sent to SQS queues. Lambda takes care of 
our scaling needs and we can focus on our business logic.

To recap in this section we covered:

* DynamoDB Streams
* Deploying Lambda Functions
* Configuring Event Sources for Lambda Functions
* Testing and Troubleshooting of Lambda functions
