# TODO List Task Assignments

In our TODO List application each task in a TODO list can be assigned to a user. We want to use a Lambda function
to notifiy users when they have been assigned a task. To implement this we need to implement the following steps.

* Enable a DynamoDB Stream for our TODOList table
* Write and Deploy a Lambda function
* Configure DynamoDB Stream as a source for Lambda function
