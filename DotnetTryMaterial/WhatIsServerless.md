# What is a serverless application?

## No server management

There is no need to provision or maintain any servers. There is no software or runtime to install, maintain, or administer. 

## Flexible scaling

Your application can be scaled automatically or by adjusting its capacity through toggling the units of consumption (e.g. throughput, memory) rather than units of individual servers.

## Pay for value

Pay for consistent throughput or execution duration rather than by server unit.

## Automated high availability

Serverless provides built-in availability and fault tolerance. You don't need to architect for these capabilities since the services running the application provide them by default.
